# About Me

A few years ago, I was working in a Bristol store for a mobile phone network. Regularly, customers would come in seeking help with their devices. Although it was not a service the company expected us to provide, I always jumped at the opportunity to aid these members of the public by explaining the issues, and showing them how I fixed it.

Easing the frustrations of others through sharing my knowledge has always felt rewarding. Therefore I decided to setup my own business to provide these services to members of my local community. 

Please look at the map below to see if you're within my area for in-person support. If you're not, I may still be able to provide help remotely via a video call, or screenshare.
