Computers
---------

Slow computer? Won't turn on? Need to get your files from it?

I have 15 years experience using and supporting Windows and Apple Mac computers, so if you need support or advice regarding your computer, no matter how big or small, please feel free to ask.

I can also answer queries about games consoles, cameras and other electronics.

Online
------

Want to explore the capabilities of the online world but afraid of the potential risks?

I can show you best practices so you that can browse the web more safely. Worry less about bad links, scam emails and dodgy attachments.

Communication
-------------

Would you like to message family and friends through the computer, tablet or smartphone?

Want to receive or send photos to them? How about having video calls or 'Facetime'?

I can get these setup for you and help you get familiar with them. I'll even write a guide for you to refer back to should you need it.

Mobile Phones
-------------

"There's an app for that!"  
That's great but if you're not comfortable with how your phone works, doing anything on it can be incredibly frustrating!

Together we can explore your phone while I demonstrate and explain features you wish to understand better. If you need essential apps setup, like the NHS app, we can do that. Similarly, if the phone is slowly or has an issue, I can diagnose it.

TV and Wifi
-----------

Something up with your TV?  
Are channels not showing up or are you having trouble with streaming service apps?

Does your home internet keep going down or you're just overpaying for the service? Get in touch and let's take a look!
